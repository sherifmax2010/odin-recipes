    <h1>Garlic Mushrooms</h1>
    <img src="../photos/galic.jpg">
    <p>These garlic mushrooms are easy to make by saut√©ing sliced mushrooms in butter with red wine. Delicious with grilled steaks or on top of toasted bread for a tasty appetizer.</p>
    <p>I've cooked mushrooms with white wine a bunch of times but never thought of using red. For this recipe I used a very robust Chianti, and it turned out fantastic! I added the garlic when the shrooms were partially softened - 10 minutes would have burned it horribly. Thanks!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>pounds sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>cup red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook and stir until mushrooms are a light golden brown and liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, and pour wine into the skillet. Simmer until wine has mostly evaporated. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
