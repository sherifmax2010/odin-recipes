    <h1>Easy Roasted Broccoli</h1>
    <img src="../photos/easy.jpg">
    <p>Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled. My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.</p>
    <p>While this recipe works best with fresh florets, you can technically make it with frozen broccoli. Donâ€™t thaw the broccoli at all before roasting, just stick it in the oven straight from the freezer. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ounces broccoli</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
